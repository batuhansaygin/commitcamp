## Last Session
- **Date**: 2026-02-12
- **What we did**: 
  - Phase 2 FULLY COMPLETED (all 4 sub-phases):
    - 2A: Snippets (full CRUD with server actions)
    - 2B: Forum + Comments (posts CRUD, type filter, comments, solved toggle)
    - 2C: Profiles + Follow + Feed (profile pages, settings, follow system, feed)
    - 2D: Messaging (DM inbox, chat threads, read receipts, send messages)
  - Created dev rules (.cursor/rules/dev-rules.mdc)
  - Set up AI memory system (.cursor/rules/)

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Phase 2 COMPLETE — all social features implemented
- **Blocking issues**: None known
- **Environment**: Development (remote Supabase)
- **Build**: 0 errors, all pages compile

## What's Working Now
- 8 developer tools (client-side)
- Auth (email + OAuth)
- Snippets CRUD
- Forum with comments + type filter + solved toggle
- User profiles with stats + follow/unfollow
- Feed (posts + snippets from followed users)
- DM messaging with read receipts
- Settings (profile editing)
- Admin panel (skeleton)
- i18n (EN/TR)
- Dark/light theme

## Potential Next Steps
1. Admin panel — real data (user management, content moderation)
2. Supabase Realtime — live message updates, notifications
3. Search — full-text search across snippets, posts, users
4. Reactions & bookmarks — UI for existing tables
5. Deployment — Vercel + production Supabase
6. Testing — unit tests, E2E tests

## Important Notes for AI
- Always read `md/project-log.md` if you need detailed history
- Always update this file when completing major tasks
- Always update `md/project-log.md` with detailed changes
- Supabase migrations: AI handles all migrations, never manual push
- Use `supabase link` with env vars before any migration operations
